# Legacy System Modernization Project

## Overview
The Legacy System Modernization Project is divided into multiple smaller projects, each focusing on a critical aspect of managing and modernizing legacy systems. Each project is broken into milestones, tasks, and deliverables to make the work structured and goal-oriented. This enhanced plan includes additional software, administrative access configurations, and advanced security measures such as authorization.

2. Set weak passwords and add users with excessive administrative privileges.
   - **Deliverable:** A vulnerability description file.

### Milestone 3: Document Environment
**Tasks:**
1. Create a dependency map documenting software, dependencies, and versions.
   - **Deliverable:** `dependency_map.md`.
2. Summarize the system overview, including vulnerabilities, admin accounts, and setup details.
   - **Deliverable:** `system_overview.md`.

## Project 2: Securing and Debugging the Legacy System

### Milestone 1: Conduct Security Assessment
**Tasks:**
1. Perform vulnerability scans using tools like Nmap or OpenVAS.
   - **Deliverable:** A detailed `vulnerability_report.md`.
2. Analyze the scan results and identify high-priority risks related to admin access and outdated software.
   - **Deliverable:** Risk assessment notes.

### Milestone 2: Patch Management
**Tasks:**
1. Write custom patch scripts to address vulnerabilities (e.g., disable SMBv1, remove admin privileges from unnecessary accounts).
   - **Deliverable:** Patch scripts (`patches/patch1.ps1`, etc.).
2. Apply patches and verify fixes using follow-up scans.
   - **Deliverable:** A post-patch vulnerability report.

### Milestone 3: Debug Legacy Dependencies
**Tasks:**
1. Identify and resolve compatibility issues with debugging tools like WinDbg and Dependency Walker.
   - **Deliverable:** Debugging notes and resolutions.
2. Test and validate functionality of all installed software after debugging.
   - **Deliverable:** Functional test results.

## Project 3: Modernization and Migration

### Milestone 1: Virtualization of Legacy System
**Tasks:**
1. Migrate the legacy system to a Windows 11 virtual machine.
   - **Deliverable:** Virtualized Windows 11 environment with legacy apps installed.
2. Test legacy applications for compatibility with modern security measures (e.g., UAC enforcement).
   - **Deliverable:** Compatibility test results.

### Milestone 2: Containerization of Applications
**Tasks:**
1. Use Docker to containerize legacy apps (e.g., PHP, MySQL, Apache).
   - **Deliverable:** Dockerfiles and application containers.
2. Deploy and test containerized applications on a secure cloud platform.
   - **Deliverable:** Deployment guide and test results.

### Milestone 3: Data Migration
**Tasks:**
1. Export data from MySQL 5.1 and import into MySQL 8.0, ensuring proper authorization configurations.
   - **Deliverable:** Migrated data files.
2. Verify data integrity and document the migration process.
   - **Deliverable:** `migration_guide.md`.
